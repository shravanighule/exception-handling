What is a Exception Handling?
Exception handling in C++ is a mechanism to manage runtime errors, allowing a program to catch and respond to errors, rather than crashing or producing incorrect results.
This mechanism ensures that the program can handle unexpected situations gracefully and continue to run.
The primary components of exception handling in C++ are:

1. try block: The try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. Any code within the try block is executed normally unless an exception occurs. If an exception is thrown during the execution of the code in the try block, the control is immediately transferred to a corresponding catch block.

Syntax: try { // Code that may throw an exception }

2. throw statement: In C++, the throw statement is used to signal the occurrence of an exception, typically when an error or an unexpected situation is encountered. When a throw statement is executed, control is transferred to the nearest enclosing catch block that can handle the exception. If no appropriate catch block is found, the program terminates.

Syntax: throw expression; // 'expression' can be of any type (e.g., integer, object, string, etc.)

3. catch block: The catch block follows the try block and handles exceptions that are thrown by the code inside the try block. You can have multiple catch blocks to handle different types of exceptions. If an exception is thrown, control passes to the first catch block whose exception type matches.

Syntax: catch (exceptionType e) { // Code to handle the exception }

Advantages of Exception Handling:
Separation of Error Handling: It separates error-handling code from the main logic of the program, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.
Program Continuity: Instead of terminating the program, exceptions allow for proper error recovery and graceful exit.
Improved Debugging: Exception handling provides a structured way to capture and handle errors, aiding in debugging.
Disadvantages of Exception Handling:
Performance Overhead: Throwing and catching exceptions incurs some overhead compared to using simple return values or error codes.
Overuse: Overusing exceptions for minor errors can clutter code and make it harder to maintain.
Complexity: Exception handling can introduce complexity, especially in larger programs with multiple try and catch blocks.
For example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        throw "Division by zero error"; // Throw an exception
    }
    return a / b;
}

int main() {
    try {
        int result = divide(10, 0); // Attempt to divide by zero
        cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
    }
    catch (const char* e) {
        cout << "Error: " << e << endl; // Catch and handle the exception
    }
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT: Error: Division by zero error
Algorithms
Step 1: Identify the critical code where exceptions may occur.
Step 2: Enclose the critical code inside a try block.
Step 3: Use throw to signal an exception when an error occurs.
Step 4: Catch the exception using a catch block that matches the exception type.
Step 5: Optionally, use multiple catch blocks for different exception types or a catch(...) block for all exceptions.
Step 6: Handle the exception inside the catch block and continue or terminate the program safely.
